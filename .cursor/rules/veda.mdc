# Veda Healthcare Chatbot – Project Rules

## General
- Use **JavaScript** only (no TypeScript).
- Use **React.js** for frontend, **FastAPI** for backend, and **MongoDB** for database.
- Follow modular, clean, and well-commented code practices.

## Development Flow
- first Execute Phase F (F00–F09) **frontend-only** exactly as defined in `plan.md`.
- Until Phase F is completed,  Do NOT modify: backend/** , docker/**, docker-compose.yml, .env (except adding FRONTEND vars in .env.example).
- Use mocks: VITE_USE_MOCK_API=true, services/mockApi.js must be used for data; do not call a live backend.
- WebSocket: use mocked streaming in hooks/useWebSocket.js until `Phase F` is completed.
- Always align with `plan.md` for overall structure.

## UI
- Similar layout to ChatGPT, but with a **light gradient background** (no dark theme).
- Ensure that UI colors and styles remain consistent across the entire app.
- Must be fully **responsive** for desktop and mobile.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Features
- Login/Signup as first page, with **Google Login integration**.
- Chatbot supports:
  - Text input
  - Image uploads
  - Voice input
- Use **own fine-tuned LLM** (no OpenAI API).

## File & Project Organization
- Keep each section/component in its own file for readability.
- Store documentation in `/docs` (`roadmap.md`, `plan.md`).
